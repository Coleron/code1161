The "World Religion" topic of my choice is about the trending of worshipers over time. I have commited myself to work on a global data spreadsheet.

Since i was working the Kaggle Kernal, i might give Jupyter a go and apply the data from the kernal into Jupyter nothbooks. Hopefully my data sheet will be done for next weeks presentaion.
