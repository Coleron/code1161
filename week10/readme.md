The task of the week was to create an account on Kaggle to learn about Pandas for the upcomming assignment. From what i have learnt in Kaggle is the data set of Pokemon which demonstrates the entry data from each pokemon showcasing their properties to one another.

By changing and manipulating the code in the data entry i was able to create different combinations of data to see which individual pokemon would become the strongest, fastest ect. By showcasing graphs and charts gives ideas for the current assignment.
My current topic would be about World Religions Data Set being worshiped in a country or a Automobile dataset protraying the maximum amount of produced cars in their lifespan.
